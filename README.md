# Ubiquiti-Device-UNMS-Enable
A sometimes functional script for enabling UNMS feature on Ubiquiti equipment.
Runs on /24 network by default (change network in script).
Change user.txt, pass.txt, and unms.key files before running.
Works great on my Ubuntu 16.04 server without GUI.
Doesn't work on my Ubunty 16.10 server with GUI.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
